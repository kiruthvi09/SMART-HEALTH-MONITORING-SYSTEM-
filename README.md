# SMART-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM-
This project focuses on developing a smart health monitoring system using the MAX30102 sensor, MLX90614 sensor, OLED display, and ThingSpeak portal for data visualization and analysis.
 The "SMART HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM" mainly focuses on patient care, Specifically the patients who needs a extreme supervision on their vitals and by using this project we could monitor the patient carefully using these IoT platforms . 
 This project needs more calibration inorder to use it in real world. Note that its just a prototype.
